In fact, by the looks of the weather forecast, chances are you may not even call it a hash.

Alas, we&#8217;ll press on and persevere. In fact, we&#8217;ll probably pass Noah in a boat, mooning us with a couple of baboons. Don&#8217;t let all that dissuade you wanks from coming out. It&#8217;ll be one of the last times, not talking Revelations here, that we can enjoy ourselves without those meddling kids (read: undergrads). Solving mysteries on trail, however, is not allowed. In fact, actively dissuaded.
