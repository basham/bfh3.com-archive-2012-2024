We just can&#8217;t get enough of Lake Griffy! And hashing! And beer! So we&#8217;re laying trail at Griffy again! But this won&#8217;t be your mama&#8217;s Lake Griffy!* This time, IT&#8217;S REAL.**<\/p>\n<p>Join the Blooming Fools for a romp through the countryside this Saturday, April 27, starting at 4 pm, with a trail hared by Mothershucker and White Lightning. Why should you join the wankers for a romp through the countryside, you ask? Because there&#8217;ll be beer, mostly. But there&#8217;ll also be a jillion of your closest friends, frolicking through the undergrowth on a beautiful Indiana spring day, ready to hold you to their hearts and love the heck out of you. (And there&#8217;ll be snacks, too, if the jillion of your closest friends doesn&#8217;t do it for you. C&#8217;mon.)<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/vlcsnap-1887744.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/vlcsnap-1887744.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"vlcsnap-1887744\" width=\"672\" height=\"384\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-810\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/vlcsnap-1887744.png 672w, http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/vlcsnap-1887744-300x171.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nThis hash will cost you $6 if you&#8217;ve been to the hash before. If you&#8217;re bringing a virgin, the virgin will get in free. Or you could tell the virgin the hash costs $3, payable to you, and then you&#8217;d only have to pay $3 yourself. Cheep!<\/p>\n<p>Directions: Trail will start at the Lake Griffy boathouse parking lot. It&#8217;s located where North Headley Road becomes North Hinkle Road. From the intersection of North Walnut Street and the 45\/46 Bypass, head east on the 45\/46 Bypass. Go to the second light (Fee Lane will be to your right), and turn left onto East Matlock Road. Take that road a ways until you go down a big hill and cross the empty lakebed. Turn right into the boathouse parking lot, and look for the wankers passing out from the excitement.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a link to the start: http:\/\/goo.gl\/maps\/lLbxj<\/p>\n<p>On on!<\/p>\n<p>* I don&#8217;t know what this means.<br \/>\n** This is pretty meaningless too, really.
