Cum often!<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s been almost a year since your last Labor Day Hash, and you\u2019ve been slipped the bone more times than you can count. Impatient half-mind that you are, you just can\u2019t hold out until September to get it out of your system. But if you\u2019re pregnant with anticipation, there\u2019s no need to throw out the baby with the hash soup. By Saturday August 31 at 4PM, your yearnings for beer should be two minutes apart, and shiftless wankers will unite at the Cutright SRA for a welcum delivery from their agony.<\/p>\n<p>Your OB-GYNs, Circuscision, Inhego Girls, and No Dong and Thanks for all the Fish, will nurse you through the ups and downs and induce you to push through the shiggy. We can\u2019t promise a painless experience. There will be no lumbar punch (though a donkey punch is always a possibility), you may get a thistle epidural, and there will be spankings at the end. But the anesthesiologist will ease you through the procedure with periodic infusions of beer. And a lucky few may even achieve the mythical orgasmic birth.<\/p>\n<p>Expecting wanks: $6<br \/>\nVirgin births: Free<\/p>\n<p>Please note: This may be a water birth, so dress appropriately. Also, you may bring your own personal doula, but dog owners are advised that there may be broken glass on the floor of the OR, so caveat canis.<\/p>\n<p>Where : Cutright S.R.A, Lake Monroe<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=39.066935,+-86.406817\">https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=39.066935,+-86.406817<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Directions: From East Third St., take SR446 south to Lake Monroe. Cross the causeway and turn left into Cutright SRA. Precise location TBD (probably the same place as the 4th of July Hash). Since it\u2019s Labor Day weekend, parking may be scarce. Carpooling is encouraged.<\/p>\n<p>When: Sat, Aug 31, 2013 at 4pm<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cum early! Cum often!
