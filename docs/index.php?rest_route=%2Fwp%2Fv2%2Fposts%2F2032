This is your chance to dress up like all college girls on Halloween&#8230;as a sexy cat!<\/p>\n<p>Just as we know that some hashers are turkeys and some are eagles, in the famous words of legendary swim coach Bill Boomer, some athletes are more like cats, while some need to be trained like dogs. &#8220;I look at athletes in how they interact with the environment via the nervous system and I call it cats and dogs. A cat in the natural world lives, exists in that world, survives in that world in a totally different way than the dog does. The dog runs down their prey, they work hard and accomplish what their goals are in a pack. They are successful through work and volume. The cats burn really hot- after they have a short fast burn they may need 3 or 4 hours before they can work again.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Whether you consider yourself a cat or a dog, we guarantee a good time&#8230;.or at least some beer&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>This is a cat friendly event, and while I suppose we&#8217;ll allow dog friendly folks, no actual dogs allowed.
