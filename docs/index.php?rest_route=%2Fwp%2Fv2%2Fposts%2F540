That is excellent, late-breaking news.<\/p>\n<p>You know what else is super-de-duper cool about November 28?? It is the 333rd day of 2012 and there are 33 more days until 2013!! That makes is a good day for a 3some. And, if you are not into that, there\u2019s still a fool moon hash.<\/p>\n<p>START TIME: 6:30 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>LOCATION: Olcott Park<\/p>\n<p>HARE: Dowelrod<\/p>\n<p>SUGGESTED ATTIRE: A SKIRT\u2026.please?! Boys and girls. It\u2019s the eve of my birthday, and I would like everybody to wear a fancy skirt. Plus, it\u2019ll make the 3some\u2019s more likely to happen. If you are into that kind of thing.<\/p>\n<p>COST: $6 if you are wearing a skirt, $7 if you are not. The $1 dollar will go to making Jingle Balls more awesome. I probably can\u2019t enforce that rule and didn\u2019t get permission from the Joint Masters to suggest it, but if everyone wears a skirt, that will be awesome. And, for those who don\u2019t have $7 it is $6. Oh, and Virgins are free!! But, if you bring a virgin, make them wear a skirt. So they feel more at home.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NOVEMBER TWENTY-EIGHT, TWO-THOUSAND AND TWELVE. \u201cOn this day in history, in 741, St. Gregory III ends his reign as Catholic Pope.\u201d Well, that\u2019s dull! \u201cIn 1821 Panama declares independence from Spain.\u201d Slightly less boring, but still\u2026what is so good about &hellip; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/?p=540\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[7],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/index.php?rest_route=\/wp\/v2\/posts\/540"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/index.php?rest_route=\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/index.php?rest_route=\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/index.php?rest_route=\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/index.php?rest_route=%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fcomments&post=540"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/index.php?rest_route=\/wp\/v2\/posts\/540\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":579,"href":"http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/index.php?rest_route=\/wp\/v2\/posts\/540\/revisions\/579"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/index.php?rest_route=%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fmedia&parent=540"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/index.php?rest_route=%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fcategories&post=540"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/index.php?rest_route=%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Ftags&post=540"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
