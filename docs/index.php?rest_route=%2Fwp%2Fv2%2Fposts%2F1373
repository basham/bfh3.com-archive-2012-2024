The usual hash technicalities apply: There&#8217;s no preregistration for this one, just bring $6 for experienced hashers, and first-timers are free. Someone bring a flashlight just in case.<\/p>\n<p>On Saturday, the 2014 <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Red Dress Hash<\/span><\/strong> starts at 2pm from the IU Cyclotron parking lot in Bloomington. Red dresses are mandatory! Expect to spend a few hours on trail, with dinner to follow post-trail circle. Here are directions to the start:<\/p>\n<p>The address of the IU Cyclotron (or it might be called the Indiana University Integrated Science and Accelerator Technology Hall, or The Center for Exploration of Energy and Matter) is 2401 Milo B Sampson Lane in Bloomington. From downtown Bloomington, go north on Walnut to the IN-45\/46 East Bypass. Turn right onto the bypass (toward the football stadium). Across from the football stadium parking lot should be signs for Technology Park North; turn left\/north onto Milo B. Sampson Lane, and go to the parking lot in the back.<\/p>\n<p>From Indy or farther north, take IN-37 to the 45\/46 exit and go toward Bloomington. Keep going straight through four stoplights (you&#8217;ll pass Denny&#8217;s on your right) and look the sign to Technology Park North on the north side of the bypass.<\/p>\n<p>From Louisville, take I-65 to the Columbus\/Nashville IN-46 exit, and follow 46 through Nashville. Stay on 46 for a long time &#8212; once you get to Bloomington, you&#8217;ll pass College Mall on your left &#8212; and turn right onto the bypass (still following IN-46). Take the bypass till you see the Technology Park North sign on your right.<\/p>\n<p>What? Still not registered for the 2014 Red Dress Hash? IT&#8217;S NOT TOO LATE!
