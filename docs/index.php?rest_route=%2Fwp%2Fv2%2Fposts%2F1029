There will be something for everyone, so feel free to bring your\u00a0horrors!<\/p>\n<p>There will be a lot of less strenuous work than last time, if you want. The shiggy has gotten really bad so we need several people to walk the trails and\u00a0trim the shiggy so it doesn&#8217;t bite. Bring your own clippers if you have them, and let us know that this is your preference when signing in.<\/p>\n<p>Wear comfortable work clothes that you don&#8217;t mind getting dirty, wear sturdy, closed-toe shoes or boots, and douse yourself in bug spray and sun-screen. It&#8217;s also a good idea to wear a hat. And bring water to drink.<\/p>\n<p>Tools, work gloves, and training will be provided. And stick around for the On-After with food and beer for all who show up to the work day.<\/p>\n<p>Who: BloomingFools (including the Horrors!), and anyone else who wants to help out<\/p>\n<p>What: Wapehani Trail Adopters second summer work day<\/p>\n<p>When: Saturday, July 27.
