You\u2019ve never been to a Blooming Fools Jingle Balls before? Well, pull up a snowball and we\u2019ll tell you all about it. The festivities start at 2pm, with a reindeer games trail hared by Psychedelic \u201cShermy\u201d Cumfountain and Untouched \u201cSchroeder\u201d Private Panther. Then, after a super-festive circle, we\u2019ll reconvene at Mama Said Pop You Out\u2019s place for the Jingle Balls Ball, a formal hash occasion featuring food, music, fabulous commemorative goodies, beverages (of course), and the legendary Blooming Fools White Elephant Gift Exchange. Bring a hash gift, take a hash gift! We recommend that if you buy something new, you spend around $10 \u2013 but be creative! And remember, it\u2019s for a hasher, so think about what hashers like!<\/p>\n<h6><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2096_4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft\" alt=\"2096_4\" src=\"http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/2096_4-150x150.jpg\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" \/><\/a><strong>George Bailey<\/strong>: What is it you want, Mary?
