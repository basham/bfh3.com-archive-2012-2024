Painting one&#8217;s face Braveheart style also encouraged, but still not required.<br \/>\n__________________________<wbr \/>_______________________<\/p>\n<p>Quick details for the event:<br \/>\nThis event is a *little* more managed than normal hashes. The $15 price reflects special parts of trail included such as Scotch toastings, Scottish beer, and a rolling dinner (4 courses along the way!) We highly recommend this option as you&#8217;ll look awkward refusing alcohol and incredible food. We don&#8217;t want you to look awkward, so please let us know if the price is a problem for you. (Regulars $15 trail and feast [$7 for trail only]<br \/>\nVirgins $8 trail and feast (free for trail only)].<\/p>\n<p>Who: You, specifically, hashers, bashers and virgins of all types are welcome at this event. You&#8217;ll meet two hares and two bares who will lay trail together to each beer stop (likely 4 of them).<br \/>\nYou get to choose your trail: will you hash or will you bash (hashing with a bike)?<\/p>\n<p>What: This trail brings together the best aspects of hashing and bashing by rejoicing with our sister group while still choosing your favorite mode of travel (or maybe something new) to find beer. This event includes a 4-course rolling dinner, special beer, Scotch and really shitty company.<\/p>\n<p>When: Although Burns Night is typically January 25, we&#8217;re taking advantage of the Hash and Bash dates for 1\/24.<\/p>\n<p>Where: Whoa, whoa, slow down, we&#8217;re not there yet!<\/p>\n<p>Why: We&#8217;re celebrating the life of the Scottish bard Robbie Burns and world-famous poet. You may know him through singing Auld Lang Syne on NYE before the ball drops. It&#8217;s the most covered song on planet earth, right behind &#8220;Happy Birthday.&#8221; He did a lot of cool other shit too. People all around the world celebrate this date.<\/p>\n<p>How: Great Scottish booze, a shitty trail, decent people.<br \/>\nKilts are highly encouraged.<\/p>\n<p>When:\u00a0Sunday, January 24 at 3 PM<br \/>\nWhere: TBA<br \/>\nHow much: Regulars\u00a0$15 trail and feast ($7 for trail only),\u00a0Virgins $8 trail and feast (free for trail only)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;Freedom and Whisky gang thegither, Tak oft yer dram!
