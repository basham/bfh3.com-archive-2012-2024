Trail begins promptly (ha) at 4 p.m., your hares will be Goesentite and White Lightning, and of course the admission price is a mere $6 for trail, snacks, and beer beer alternative beverages beer (cheep!). Unless it\u2019s your first time, in which case you can hash for free. (Oh, and cell phones on trail are a technology-on-trail violation. Geek.)<\/p>\n<p>We don\u2019t care if WarGames is on TV, dammit \u2013 come to the hash and get some sunlight and vitamin D. Honestly, you\u2019re looking a little pale.<\/p>\n<p>(P.S.: Extra doofy sincerity points for you if you participated in Hands Across America, which took place on May 25, 1986. The hares will admit to nothing.)<\/p>\n<p>Directions: From College Mall, take Second Street west. Way west. Like, past Walnut and College, and past the hospital, and past Landmark. When you pass the Twin Lakes Recreation Center on your right, look for S. Weimer Rd. on your left. The intersection of Weimer and Second is before the entrance to the softball fields if you&#8217;re coming from town, so&#8230;look at the map. Park, hash.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/?q=to%3AWapehani+Mountain+Bike+Park%4039.141537%2C-86.569931\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/maps.google.com\/<wbr>?q=to%3AWapehani+Mountain+B<wbr>ike+Park%4039.141537%2C-86<wbr>.569931<\/wbr><\/wbr><\/wbr><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/photo.htm\">photo<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On May 25, 1977, the first Star Wars movie was released.
