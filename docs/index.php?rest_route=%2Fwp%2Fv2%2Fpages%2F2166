Drag out the goofy holiday sweaters, sparkly dresses, slightly-less-worn-out jeans, santa hats, candy-cane accessories, and come on down to <strong>The Lodge<\/strong> at <strong>101 E.

For those of you who weren\u2019t around for the epic Tite\/WL Jingle Ball 2013, that\u2019s the space above Subway, at Sixth &amp; Walnut, with giant windows looking out onto the holiday lights at the square. Look for a big, badass, old-school door on Sixth Street and follow the stairway to hash heaven!<\/p>\n<p>Upstairs, you will find a well-organized and clear process for check-in! Maybe! Probably! Check yourself and your White Elephant gift in, pick up your swag, and then get out there and mingle! There will be decorations, lights, hasher portraits by the Christmas tree, beer, food, music, and merriment! A menu will be posted and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/?page_id=2279\"><strong><u>linked here<\/u><\/strong> <\/a>as soon as we can get our shit together!<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Gift Exchange<\/u><\/strong>: After dinner, the real party starts with our traditional BFH3 White Elephant gift exchange! For those who\u2019ve never had the pleasure, a white elephant gift exchange, also sometimes called a Dirty Santa gift exchange, is when everyone brings a wrapped, unlabeled gift. Wankers are called up in reverse order of hash seniority (i.e., how many times each wank has hashed with BFH3) and must choose to either unwrap a new gift or steal one which has already been unwrapped. When everywank who brought a present has a present, we\u2019re done! Not sure what to bring? Well, think like a half-mind! What do you want to take home? A rad hash accessory? A bizarre sex toy? A bottle of tasty Christmas alcohol? A funny shirt? A big yummy beer? We recommend you spend about $10 on whatever-it-is, but that\u2019s up to you. So put on your thinking cap and come up with something that everywank will want to steal, and that White Lightning will probably end up taking home and treasuring forever (because that is one wanker who hasn\u2019t had a life for 19 years, thank G.)<\/p>\n<p>After the gift exchange is done there will be dancing and socializing until we kick everyone out at midnight!<a href=\"#rego\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"  wp-image-2240 alignright\" src=\"http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/RegoFoot-150x150.png\" alt=\"RegoFoot\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>One last note: Volunteers Needed!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Every year there are those helpful sorts of wanks who ask mismanagement how they can help, or why the hell they weren\u2019t allowed to help, or wish we MMs would just stop bitching already about all the work and ask for some freakin\u2019 help already.
