Have you hared a couple of times and would like to hone your skills? Are you getting tired of always blaming your co-hare when half the kennel gets lost on your trails?<\/p>\n<p>Well then, come to hare school! We&#8217;ll run you through the basics of choosing a location, scouting your trail, finding a good location for beer check and On-In, and laying flour in a way that will keep the pack together while confounding the FRBs.<\/p>\n<p>There will be a lecture and lab portion of the course. Lecture will consist of the basic theory of choosing a location, learning to read a map, and laying a good trail. Then for lab, we&#8217;ll venture out and put your new skills to the test by laying an actual hash trail.<\/p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t just for virgin hares. Experienced hares are encouraged to attend and offer their own tips and tricks learned along the way and to run and critique the trail laid by the students.<\/p>\n<p>When: Saturday, June 1, 2:00pm<\/p>\n<p>Where: Morrison Hall 007, 1165 E.
