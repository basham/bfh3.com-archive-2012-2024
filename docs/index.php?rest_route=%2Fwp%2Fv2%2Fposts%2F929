Your hares will be Mothershucker and White Lightning, and we guarantee that there&#8217;ll be beer, beer, alternative beverages, snacky foods, shiggy trail, significant bodies of water, and probably some beer, too. The cost is the usual $6 for returners (cheep!) and nothing for first-timers.<\/p>\n<p>There will also be an All-American cookout following the hash, featuring Rice&#8217;s Chili Cheese Dogs and other meat and non-meat options; it&#8217;s a mere $7 (cheep! and that includes beer).<\/p>\n<p>Trail&#8217;s going to start at 4:00 pm starting from Cutright State Recreation Area, which is just across the causeway. Take 446 south from Third Street and cross the big bridge across Lake Monroe (that&#8217;s the causeway). Turn left immediately after you cross the lake into Cutright State Recreation Area. Go straight on that road for a while until you see hashers gathering in anticipation of trail. Or beer. Or both.
