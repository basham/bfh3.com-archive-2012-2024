Octopussy informed him th<\/span><\/span><\/span><span itemprop=\"description\"><span class=\"fsl\"><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">at a common mistake that hares make when trying to design a trail to be completely BloomingFoolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete BloomingFools. \u201cThere is an art, or rather, a knack to haring,\u201d said Octopussy. \u201cThe knack lies in learning how to throw flour at a visible place on the ground and miss.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But why would Circus and Octopussy even bother with a Thursday Wild Hare? Here\u2019s why. You sass that hoopy <\/span><\/span><\/span><span itemprop=\"description\"><span class=\"fsl\"><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">No Dong and Thanks for all the Fish? There&#8217;s a frood who really knows where her whistle is.<\/p>\n<p>(Sass: know, be aware of, meet, have sex with; hoopy: really together harriette; frood: really amazingly together harriette.)<\/p>\n<p>But that hoopy frood is skipping town on Friday for a summer of debauchery with kennels in Amsterdam and points East where she may imbibe vast quantities of Wank\u2019s Spirit. Wank\u2019s Spirit is a rather potent alcoholic beverage, and is used heavily in drinking games that are played in the Dutch kennels, as immortalized in that ancient Dutch hashing song:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOh don\u2019t give me<\/span><\/span><\/span><span itemprop=\"description\"><span class=\"fsl\"><span class=\"text_exposed_show\"> no more of that Old Wank\u2019s Spirit<br \/>\nNo, don\u2019t you give me no more of that Old Wank\u2019s Spirit<br \/>\nFor my head (wsh?) will fly, my tongue will lie, my eyes will fry and I may die<br \/>\nWon\u2019t you pour me one more of that sinful Old Wank\u2019s Spirit?\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span> So you just come along with us and have a good time. The hash is a fun place. You&#8217;ll need to have this fish in your ear.
