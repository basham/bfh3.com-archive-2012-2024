<p>Cum one, cum all, to the 2nd annual boulder holder hash! Ticks and tits will be present. Wear your best boulder holder (up top or down below)! You will want tick repellent and bug spray indeed. But wait! There’s more! $7 gets you beer and food for the on-after at Papa Sidewalk’s. It may get a little toasty by the fire. Be sure to bring your lawn chairs if you don’t want chiggers in those crevices!</p>



<p>PSA: As much as we love to have fun, please make sure to have a safe ride home as there will be no adult sleepovers at this hash. Thanks in advance!&nbsp;</p>

In fact, if the Olympic judges were around this hash Saturday, they&#8217;d probably give this group of delirious half minded hashers a gold medal in synchronized swimming. Alas, we&#8217;ll press on and persevere. In fact, we&#8217;ll probably pass Noah in a boat, mooning us with a couple of baboons. Don&#8217;t let all that dissuade you wanks from coming out. It&#8217;ll be one of the last times, not talking Revelations here, that we can enjoy ourselves without those meddling kids (read: undergrads). Solving mysteries on trail, however, is not allowed. In fact, actively dissuaded. One thing you can guarantee on, is that your hares Brings Up The Rear (just call him BUTRz) and Get A Classroom will provide you with an amazingly shitty trail&#8230; or at least a trail&#8230; well&#8230; maybe just beer&#8230; on second thought&#8230; at least this hash invite.</p>
<p>For folks who routinely read BUTRz ranty hash invites and have hashed before the cost is $7. For all you poor folks who have not (i.e., virgins), it&#8217;s free!</p>
<p>Hares: Brings Up The Rear &amp; Get A Classroom<br />
Start location: Park Ridge East Park (most likely the shelter)<br />
Cost: $7 for hashers, Free for Virgins</p>

<p>Location: IUB Parking Operations, 310 S Fess Ave, Bloomington, Indiana</p>
<p>The 2016 Libido Games, hared by Tri-Harder and Three Hole Punched, will provide the best possible aphrodisiacs for peak performance. Wankers will enjoy world-class shiggy, hashing through the MDP (Mesolimbic Dopamine Pathway), compactly layed for maximum endurance. Assuming you will be wet during your pursuit for a high libido, a torch will be carried on trail, commemorating the Greek God Eros and the hapPenis he brings us. (No worries&#8230;there won&#8217;t actually be a flame&#8230;.we&#8217;re not that responsible). Gold will be earned by all attending wankers. No training necessary, cum as you are. Your renewed libido will consume the need for any initially required refractory period, allowing the pursuit to cum to an end with multiple orgies in the midst of the Olympic Village. The village location will be announced once the torch has been brought back home &#8211; We don&#8217;t want any champions winning without us.<br />
$7 for prior competitors<br />
Free for new athletes</p>

Start at Boner&#8217;s Lot. Boner&#8217;s Lot (300 W. Hillside Dr.)</p>
<p>With fond memories of their first full moon lay, Hentai and Herp thought it would be fun to re-live that experience once again.</p>
<p>Join them as they try their best to lay an even shittier, fuckier, wackier, and psychadelic trail than before! Big shoes to fill, they know, but it can and will be done.</p>
<p>Returning wanks better cough up $7 to attend&#8211;virgin wanks are free!</p>
<p>More details to cum&#8230;..</p>
<p>&#8230;..and here they are!</p>
<p>-hash is crazy rainbow color-themed so come decked out in some crazy colors. If it doesn&#8217;t make us hares color-blind, you didn&#8217;t do it right&#8230;.</p>
<p>-damn Mother Nature is making things get slightly darker slightly earlier so bring some cranial lights</p>
<p>-minimal shiggy although who knows, your hares might get all evil up on this trail&#8230;.</p>
<p>-true trail roughly 3 miles for DFLs; FRBs, prepare for some fun <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
