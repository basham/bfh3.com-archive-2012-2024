You see, almost five years ago PH and ET made plans to meet up at on-after for M\u00e8nHash \u00e0 Trois, a semi-Bastille Day inspired hash with a trio of hariettes. In the same week, Sweet Ho and Rubix had their very first date after meeting on fb through yet another fellow hasher. THEN, a few weeks ago, PH and ET got married. And THEN, within that same week, SH and <span class=\"text_exposed_show\">Rubix got married. And PH is a Francophile anyway, and the French gave us the statue of liberty, and there are no lake fireworks this year so we might as well all pretend it\u2019s because we\u2019re too sophisticated to blow shit up on the 4th. Or whatever, I don\u2019t care, it\u2019s French themed. So bust out the berets and head to Fairfax SRA and party the day away!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>ET and $hot are going to lay us a trail. Then we\u2019re going to hash. Then we\u2019re going to circle and hash-marry up RubHo and Physical Tube. THEN everyone who doesn\u2019t have anything better to do than hang out at a beach side shelter and drink more beer and eat food someone else cooked and look at\/swim in\/scramble into the lake from a scenic overlook with lots of dripping wet sexy hashers for the low low price of $15 (hash included!) will do all of those things until we get kicked out of the shelter at 11:00 PM. There are even showers! Sound good?
