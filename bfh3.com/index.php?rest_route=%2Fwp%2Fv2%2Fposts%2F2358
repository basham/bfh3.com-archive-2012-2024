This Saturday, we\u2019ll be honoring our forefathers and foremothers and fore-non-procreating-antec<wbr \/>edents who were involved in repealing the evil 18th Amendment with a shiggy hash trail starting from Rev. Ernest Butler Park, otherwise known as Ninth Street Park, in Bloomington. Your hares will be two veteran trail-layers: Ship for Brains (who is emerging from his too-long hash absence!) and White Lightning, and we\u2019re going to lay trail like it\u2019s 1999! (That\u2019s not a clich\u00e9, we were laying trails just like this one in 1999. Except these days the beer is a lot better.)<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s going to cost you an ultra-modern $7 to participate, unless this is your first hash ever, in which case you\u2019ll join us for free (still cheep after all these years!) The trail will start from the western end of Ninth Street Park.
