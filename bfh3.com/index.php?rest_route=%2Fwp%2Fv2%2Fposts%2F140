Don\u2019t be fashionably late.<\/p>\n<p>The BFH3 Red Dress Hash is our annual celebration of the great international Red Dress Hash tradition, and all you need to participate is a red dress (well, and some cash to pony up for beer and food, you cheapskate). Everyone on the trail wears a red dress\u2013hares, harriers, harriettes, dogs, whatever\u2013and it takes place during the equally awesome Indiana University tradition of Little 500 weekend!<\/p>\n<p>What do you get for your hash cash, you ask?<\/p>\n<p>* A devious trail laid by hares extraordinaire Titwad and Psychedelic Cumfountain through plenty of human shiggy<br \/>\n* Beer, snacks, beer, orange food, beer, probably sugar wafers, beer, alternative beverages if you want \u2018em, and beer<br \/>\n* A goodie to wear every day for the rest of your life<br \/>\n* More fabulous fashion moments than you\u2019ve had all year (admit it)<\/p>\n<p>Following the trail, join your fellow Red Dress hashers for an elegant and lovely on-after dinner featuring the epicurean delights of resident BFH3 chef Mothershucker, who is planning a special menu to befit the occasion. Mothershucker says he\u2019s saving up his culinary creativity so he can really put out for the Red Dress, so you know it\u2019s going to be awesome. The parties surrounding the Kentucky Derby got nothing on us, seriously.<\/p>\n<p>How much is this event, you\u2019re asking? For the trail alone \u2014 including beer, snacks, and the goodie \u2014 the price is only $12 (cheep!). For the trail and the on-after picnic, the price is a mere $22 (still cheep!). And if you\u2019re stuck and can\u2019t make the trail but still want to cum to the on-after, you can do that too: the price (minus goodie, sorry) is $10 (cheeep!).<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re cumming, you can now register <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/?page_id=38\">USING THE LINK ON THIS WEBSITE<\/a>. We\u2019ve got a spiffy Paypal account set up so we can take your money more efficiently than ever. If you want to pay cash, get it to a member of mismanagement by April 14. Don\u2019t just show up, we may not have a goodie for you, and if you miss the goodie, you\u2019re gonna be sad. We don\u2019t want you to be sad.<\/p>\n<p>So shop now before the best dresses are gone, and we\u2019ll see you at the BFH3 Red Dress Hash on April 21! ON ON!<\/p>\n<p>Directions: To get to Lower Cascades Park, take Walnut north from downtown Bloomington past 17th Street, and turn left at the first crossover after Miller-Showers Park. Cross College Avenue, and proceed down Old Indiana 37 into the park. Look for the well-dressed hashers commingling in the park (but don\u2019t look too hard, because they may be so fabulous they\u2019ll cause permanent eye damage).<\/p>\n<p>Or, if you\u2019re coming from 37, take the College Ave. exit, and take the first right after the 45\/46 bypass (if you pass Steak and Shake, you\u2019ve gone too far). Cruise through the park, look for hashers, park, hash, look awesome.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to hang with the wanks at other times on Red Dress weekend, you can start by meeting us for Hash Practice, where we hone our skills at the drinking part of hashing. It will begin at 5:30 at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jakesnightclub.com\/\">Jake&#8217;s Nightclub and Bar<\/a>, 419 N. Walnut. We usually go on to dinner someplace nearby or bring food into Jake&#8217;s.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s that time of year\u2026when the hands of hashers all over Bloomington get warm and sweaty thinking about who they\u2019ll see at the hash social event of the season\u2026the 14th annual BLOOMING FOOLS RED DRESS HASH!
