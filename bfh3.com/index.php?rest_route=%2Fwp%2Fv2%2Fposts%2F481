And angry hunters with bows and arrows chasing deer (it&#8217;s deer archery season). And we&#8217;ll try to find a snake for SlapShot, but we can&#8217;t guarantee anything.<\/p>\n<p>To get there from Bloomington, go out Third Street until it becomes 46 to Nashville.

(If you follow Google Maps and decide to take Jackson Creek Road to get there, we\u2019re not waiting for you.) Take Yellowwood Road 1.2 miles, and turn left after the bridge. Then at the sign pointing different directions, turn right toward the boat ramp. Go 1.6 miles (past the boat ramp and the forest office) and look for the hashers parking on the left.
