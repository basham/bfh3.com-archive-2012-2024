the &#8220;Now Who Can We Offend THIS Weekend?&#8221; Hash</p>
<p>Thought that last weekend was the last chance you had to offend the muggles?<br />
Thinking that all that extra adipose tissue (read: &#8220;fat&#8221;) will go to waste, should you not, as soon as possible, get it out in the glorious sunshine to wiggle and waggle it&#8217;s way around in free-form, gravity-fighting wonderment?<br />
WELL FEAR NO MORE!<br />
We&#8217;ll do both! (Being lazy-azz hashers, we al&#8217;lus try to combine activities&#8230;&#8230;especially<wbr /> if it involves beer!)<br />

<p>THUSLY, AND IN DI-ERECT TRIBUTE, we will have ANOTHER GO AT THEM!<br />

Join the Blooming Fools at Cutright S.R.A. this Saturday wearing a white t-shirt over a swim suit (bottoms optional) and prepare for some shiggy, sun, and suds.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bfh3.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/10376837_848696915140774_3878995157317882154_n.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1571" alt="10376837_848696915140774_3878995157317882154_n" src="http://www.bfh3.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/10376837_848696915140774_3878995157317882154_n-300x114.jpg" width="300" height="114" srcset="http://www.bfh3.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/10376837_848696915140774_3878995157317882154_n-300x114.jpg 300w, http://www.bfh3.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/10376837_848696915140774_3878995157317882154_n.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Your hares, Mama Said Pop You Out and Hand&#8217;ersome Pooper, have some fun surprises up their dripping wet sleeves to celebrate summer and make this a memorable hash! There will be beer, there will be trail, there will be contests of strength and cunning, and there will be plenty of reasons to get your t-shirt wet.</p>
<p>Aug 2, 4pm<br />
Cutright SRA overflow parking lot (see directions below)<br />
$6 for hasher, free for virgins</p>
<p>You may want: a change of clothes, extra shoes, a towel, and virgins</p>
<p>From Bloomington: drive out 446 S. After the causeway, make the first left into the Cutright State Recreation Area. Stay right at the fork (ignore the parking lot and boat ramp to your left &#8211; those aren&#8217;t hashers). Make the second left (the paved left, not the gravel left&#8230; we&#8217;re not animals). Find hashers, drink beer, get wet.</p>
<p>NOTE: due to recent changes to google maps I refuse to use it. I&#8217;d rather not have a heart attack. If someone else wants to post one, please do&#8230; but please make sure it&#8217;s the back parking lot, not the immediate one.</p>

<p>You can take old 37 north to Anderson Road, then turn left on BeanBlossom Road. The dry lake shelter parking lot will be the first drive off to the left. Carpooling is advised!</span></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Red…Red…Red…GO BIG RED DRESS!</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s finally here&#8230;the 2014 Blooming Fools RED DRESS HASH!<br />
This year&#8217;s Red Dress festivities start on Friday evening (April 25), with Red Dress Exchange Hash Practice starting at 6pm at the Atlas Ballroom, 209 S. College Avenue in Bloomington. Bring a dress &#8212; take home a dress! Because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one</span> shows up in the same dress two years in a row. Gauche.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bfh3.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/390985_10200650259555547_1984030136_n.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1294" alt="390985_10200650259555547_1984030136_n" src="http://www.bfh3.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/390985_10200650259555547_1984030136_n-300x210.jpg" width="300" height="210" srcset="http://www.bfh3.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/390985_10200650259555547_1984030136_n-300x210.jpg 300w, http://www.bfh3.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/390985_10200650259555547_1984030136_n.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>After hash practice, the Red Dress Runup No Clue hash, hared by Princess Tiny Box and White Lightning, starts at 7:00pm from outside of Atlas. There&#8217;ll be beer, there&#8217;ll be snacks, there&#8217;ll be shiggy, there won&#8217;t be flour, but there&#8217;ll be more beer. The usual hash technicalities apply: There&#8217;s no preregistration for this one, just bring $6 for experienced hashers, and first-timers are free. Someone bring a flashlight just in case.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the 2014 <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Red Dress Hash</span></strong> starts at 2pm from the IU Cyclotron parking lot in Bloomington. Red dresses are mandatory! Expect to spend a few hours on trail, with dinner to follow post-trail circle. Here are directions to the start:</p>
<p>The address of the IU Cyclotron (or it might be called the Indiana University Integrated Science and Accelerator Technology Hall, or The Center for Exploration of Energy and Matter) is 2401 Milo B Sampson Lane in Bloomington. From downtown Bloomington, go north on Walnut to the IN-45/46 East Bypass. Turn right onto the bypass (toward the football stadium). Across from the football stadium parking lot should be signs for Technology Park North; turn left/north onto Milo B. Sampson Lane, and go to the parking lot in the back.</p>
<p>From Indy or farther north, take IN-37 to the 45/46 exit and go toward Bloomington. Keep going straight through four stoplights (you&#8217;ll pass Denny&#8217;s on your right) and look the sign to Technology Park North on the north side of the bypass.</p>
<p>From Louisville, take I-65 to the Columbus/Nashville IN-46 exit, and follow 46 through Nashville. Stay on 46 for a long time &#8212; once you get to Bloomington, you&#8217;ll pass College Mall on your left &#8212; and turn right onto the bypass (still following IN-46). Take the bypass till you see the Technology Park North sign on your right.</p>
<p>What? Still not registered for the 2014 Red Dress Hash? IT&#8217;S NOT TOO LATE! Until April 25, visit the rego link below and pay ONLY:<br />
* $20 for trail and goodie and circle<br />
* $30 for trail, goodie, circle, and food and beverages at the picnic<br />
* $10 for picnic food and beverages (no trail, no swag)</p>
<p>On April 26, the day of the GO BIG RED DRESS hash, you’ll have to pay:<br />
* $25 for trail and goodie and circle<br />
* $35 for trail, goodie, circle, and food and beverages at the picnic<br />
* $10 for picnic food and beverages (no trail, no swag)</p>
<p>To sign up for the Red Dress Hash itself, go to the <a title="Rego Page" href="http://www.bfh3.com/?page_id=1296" target="_blank">rego page!<br />
</a><br />
<strong>BUT WAIT! THERE&#8217;S MORE!</strong></p>
<p>On Sunday morning, join your new best friends and next-of-kin at the <strong>GET YOUR PANTIES IN A BRUNCH HASH!</strong></p>

Hippity hoppity beer is on its way!<a href="http://www.bfh3.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/971313_10202856280361207_240577962_n.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1342" alt="971313_10202856280361207_240577962_n" src="http://www.bfh3.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/971313_10202856280361207_240577962_n-300x179.jpg" width="300" height="179" srcset="http://www.bfh3.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/971313_10202856280361207_240577962_n-300x179.jpg 300w, http://www.bfh3.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/971313_10202856280361207_240577962_n.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>

There will be beer, shitty trail, frivolity, beer, bad singing of old worn out hash songs, maybe some green on the trees, probably no snow, beer, prizes!!! (Wooo Hoooo) and, of course, what would the celebration of the rebirth of the Lord Gispert, er Jesus, I mean, be without an Easter Keg Hunt?

The hare&#8217;s half-mind began to dash<br />
From beads to cake to flour off-white<br />
But he had yet to compose an invite.</p>
<p>He looked at pictures of New Orleans—<br />
Some beautiful (some disturbing) scenes<br />
Of Mardi gras from years bygone.<br />
But then he thought, &#8220;Screw it!&#8221; On-On!</p>
<p>Half-minds don&#8217;t need a (s)wank invitation.<br />
They just want to know where the hell in creation<br />
They might grab an ass and spy boobies to leer<br />
At and follow some flour &#8217;til they find beer.</p>
<p>So put on a mask and wear a chic dress.<br />
Get ready to be a Mardi grab-ass hot mess!</p>
<p>Who: You!</p>
<p>What: Hash!</p>
<p>Why: Beer!</p>
<p>And cake! (Did somewank say &#8220;cake&#8221;?!)</p>
<p>When: Saturday, March 1, 3pm</p>
<p>Where: Atwater Garage (*not* the Henderson Grarage—which also happens to be on Atwater—the Atwater Garage at Atwater and Woodlawn)<br />
<a href="http://goo.gl/qxrPoc" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/qxrPoc</a></p>
<p>How much: $6 for experienced masqueraders and panty raiders; Free for those whose panties have yet to be raided.</p>

<p>Yeah, we hashed at Griffy two weeks ago&#8230;yeah, we hashed near Griffy at the Red Dress Hash&#8230;we love Lake Griffy! We just can&#8217;t get enough of Lake Griffy! And hashing! And beer! So we&#8217;re laying trail at Griffy again! But this won&#8217;t be your mama&#8217;s Lake Griffy!* This time, IT&#8217;S REAL.**</p>
<p>Join the Blooming Fools for a romp through the countryside this Saturday, April 27, starting at 4 pm, with a trail hared by Mothershucker and White Lightning. Why should you join the wankers for a romp through the countryside, you ask? Because there&#8217;ll be beer, mostly. But there&#8217;ll also be a jillion of your closest friends, frolicking through the undergrowth on a beautiful Indiana spring day, ready to hold you to their hearts and love the heck out of you. (And there&#8217;ll be snacks, too, if the jillion of your closest friends doesn&#8217;t do it for you. C&#8217;mon.)<br />
<a href="http://www.bfh3.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/vlcsnap-1887744.png"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.bfh3.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/vlcsnap-1887744.png" alt="" title="vlcsnap-1887744" width="672" height="384" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-810" srcset="http://www.bfh3.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/vlcsnap-1887744.png 672w, http://www.bfh3.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/vlcsnap-1887744-300x171.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></a><br />
This hash will cost you $6 if you&#8217;ve been to the hash before. If you&#8217;re bringing a virgin, the virgin will get in free. Or you could tell the virgin the hash costs $3, payable to you, and then you&#8217;d only have to pay $3 yourself. Cheep!</p>
<p>Directions: Trail will start at the Lake Griffy boathouse parking lot. It&#8217;s located where North Headley Road becomes North Hinkle Road. From the intersection of North Walnut Street and the 45/46 Bypass, head east on the 45/46 Bypass. Go to the second light (Fee Lane will be to your right), and turn left onto East Matlock Road. Take that road a ways until you go down a big hill and cross the empty lakebed. Turn right into the boathouse parking lot, and look for the wankers passing out from the excitement.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a link to the start: http://goo.gl/maps/lLbxj</p>
<p>On on!</p>
<p>* I don&#8217;t know what this means.<br />
** This is pretty meaningless too, really. It&#8217;s a good trail, tho.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey, it’s getting down to Red Dress Hash time, and all you have in the closet (besides the handcuffs, the horse tranquilizers and the Conan the Barbarian loincloth) is the same old red dress from last year. You do NOT want to show up in that ratty old thing again—that’s totally gauche. What to do?</p>
<p>Well, you could spend hours poring over Neiman-Marcus catalogs to find a hot shift, or toil away over a hot sewing machine to perfect your muumuu, but wait! Put down the Bedazzler, dammit, and listen up!</p>
<p>Come to the Get Your Ya Yas Out Hash on April 13, where we won’t be hashing in our dresses, but we’ll be trading and swapping our hottest red habiliments in anticipation of the Go Big Red Dress Hash one week later. Oh, there’ll be trail, and shiggy, and beer, and snacks, and beer, and trail, and shiggy, and beer, but there’ll also be a dress exchange afterwards where you can trade your rags for something better. (Because we know you haven’t been able to get Blow Blow’s 2012 red dress out of your mind ALL YEAR.)<br />
<a href="http://www.bfh3.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/images.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.bfh3.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/images.jpg" alt="" title="images" width="311" height="162" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-752" srcset="http://www.bfh3.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/images.jpg 311w, http://www.bfh3.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/images-300x156.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px" /></a><br />
Your hares will be Goesentite and White Lightning, and the trail will start promptly (ha) at 4 p.m. on Saturday, April 13, from the boat rental parking lot area of Lake Griffy in Bloomington. If you’ve been to a BFH3 hash before, it’ll cost you $6 (cheep!). If you haven’t been, it’ll be free (cheepest!).</p>
<p>What? You haven’t signed up for the Go Big Red Dress Hash on April 20 yet? Well, click here: http://www.bfh3.com/?page_id=656 and sign up, because the deadline for getting fabulous 2013 BFH3 Red Dress haberdashery is coming up soon.</p>

<p>Directions:<br />
From College Books, go one block east, then turn north onto North Walnut. Take North Walnut to the second light, at the 45/46 Bypass, and turn right. Go to the second light, and turn left onto East Matlock Road. Follow that road as it twists and turns and becomes North Headley Road, and right after it crosses the lake, turn right into the boathouse parking lot. Look for wankers milling about; the most aimless-looking may be the hashers. Park. Hash.</p>
