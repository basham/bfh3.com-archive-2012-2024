They keep the trains running on time, making sure there are hares for each regularly scheduled hash, making sure trails go off around when they\u2019re supposed to, and, most importantly of all, making sure there\u2019s beer and other beverages for every hash. (Priorities!) Usually, we\u2019ve operated with two joint masters, so that at least one joint master makes it to most hashes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BeerMeisters<\/strong>: Scissor Fister, Hentai Me Up, and All Cuntry for Old Men<\/p>\n<p>The Beermeisters make sure there\u2019s beer, non-alcoholic beverages including water, snacks, girly drinks, and a small supply of reusable cups for virgins and lame-o\u2019s at every hash. Be nice to the Beermeisters, they have a holy vocation for the hash.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Religious Advisor<\/strong>: Sidewalk Cock<\/p>\n<p>The R.A. is kind of a hash helper, of sorts.\u00a0They participate in all mismanagement activities, and at circle, they anoint the virgins, lead songs, and sometimes lead circle if the joint masters can\u2019t or decide not to.<\/p>\n<p><strong>On Sec:<\/strong> Rest In Penis<\/p>\n<p>The On Sec is the manager of the hash list, updating it before every hash and making sure everyone who attends hashes signs in (including virgins).\u00a0They make sure every hasher who signs in pays in full, which is easier said than done, especially at the bigger hashes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Haberdasher<\/strong>: Peg the Patriarchy<\/p>\n<p>The hash haberdasher works with the Joint Masters to decide and design what goodies the hash is going to get, either for the three big hashes or just for kicks.\u00a0The Haberdasher also brings the old haberdashery stuff to hashes, and urges virgins and drunk veteran hashers to buy it. And the Hash Haberdasher helps with the three big annual hashes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hare Raiser:<\/strong> JMs<strong><br \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Hare Raiser is responsible for educating new, old, and upcoming hares about how best to hare, including marking techniques and finding suitable trail locations. They help to ensure logistics run smoothly between hares and Mismanagement, so hash event descriptions are published well in advance and Beermeister can accommodate the lay of the trail. And if all else fails, they hare the trail themselves.<\/p>\n<h2>Grand Masters:<\/h2>\n<p>White Lightning<br \/>Red Hot Chili Pecker<br \/>Cunning Linguist<br \/>Porn On the Cob<br \/>Snips<br \/>Titwad<br \/>Bibliosex<br \/>Mothershucker<br \/>Goesentite<br \/>Psychedelic CumFountain<br \/>Kinsey<br \/>PH<br \/>BUTRz<br \/>Lick Herp Package<br \/>Dick Ender<br \/>Responsibilibitch<\/p>\n<p>(&#8230;and I&#8217;m sure there are many others we&#8217;re forgetting&#8230;we&#8217;ve lost a lot of brain cells over the years, y&#8217;know&#8230;)<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Joint Masters: White Lightning and Psychedelic CumFountain The joint masters are the presidents, the emperors, the dictators, the grand poo-bahs of the Blooming Fools.
