At least the paper boy has stopped chasing us.<br \/>\nCIRCUSCISION: Who knew that the first paper wasn&#8217;t free like your first hash. I thought virgin readers counted for something.<br \/>\nBRINGS UP THE REAR: Nope. No way I&#8217;m giving him two dollars either, let alone seven. He didn&#8217;t even give us a beer.
