<p>Where: Olcott Park<br>When: 7pm, Tuesday, Nov 8</p>



<p>You&#8217;ve rolled back the clock on Sunday. (Welcome to the first time-adjusted trail of the season!)</p>



<p>You&#8217;ve woken early on Tuesday to witness the Blood Moon pass in front of Uranus. (According to SkyGuide, totality is 5:16 AM to 6:41 AM in Bloomington. The next Blood Moon is May 14, 2025. The next lunar/Uranus &#8220;occultation&#8221; is in 2235. So, enjoy this while you can!)</p>



<p>You&#8217;ve voted and didn&#8217;t instigate or participate in an insurrection. (Polls are open 6 AM to 6 PM.)</p>



<p>You&#8217;ve stretched. (To make room for beer and snacks.)</p>



<p>Now, join your hares UPP and Moneyshot (Team Panther-Shot) on this meager misadventure. This trail will re-break your internal clock, sacrifice blood to the celestials, and exercise your democratic rights as hash citizens.</p>



<p>Bring your light, whistle, and aspirations.</p>



<p>Location:<br>Olcott Park<br>2300 E. Canada Drive<br>Bloomington, IN 47401</p>



<p>Cost: $7 for returners, free to first-timers</p>



<p>Accepted forms of payment:<br>– Venmo: @BloomingFools (preferred)<br>– PayPal: bloomingfoolsh3@gmail.com ***FRIENDS AND FAMILY***<br>– Filthy cash&nbsp;</p>

<p>When: Saturday, November 5, 2022, starting at 4:00pm</p>



<p>Where: The Convention Center parking lot (more like the lot at the corner of Madison and 3rd). </p>



<p>This hash is on FIRE!!! Well… Guy Fawkes’ effigy is on fire… because it’s Guy Fawkes Night!</p>



<p>In honor of this irreverent wank of a British subject and PROTESTER, we plan to be even more lit than usual (if possible) by donning as much red and flames (and flame-retardant) covering as possible! You get a very hashy bonus if you are sporting red hair as part of your flaming, wanktastic get-up because it’s also NATIONAL LOVE YOUR RED HAIR DAY! Basically it saves the hares the time of having to light you on fire so it’s a win-win. Additional bonus points if you wear a Guy Fawkes/V for Vendetta/Anonymous mask.</p>



<p>But seriously, pick your protest and wear some flames to burn all the things that aren’t right with this shitty world!!!</p>



<p>Let the debauchery and good times roll!</p>



<p>Cost: $7 for regulars, free to first-time hashers!</p>



<p>Accepted forms of payment:<br>– Venmo: @BloomingFools (preferred)<br>– PayPal: bloomingfoolsh3@gmail.com ***FRIENDS AND FAMILY***<br>– Filthy cash </p>

<p>Cum one, cum all, to the 2nd annual boulder holder hash! Ticks and tits will be present. Wear your best boulder holder (up top or down below)! You will want tick repellent and bug spray indeed. But wait! There’s more! $7 gets you beer and food for the on-after at Papa Sidewalk’s. It may get a little toasty by the fire. Be sure to bring your lawn chairs if you don’t want chiggers in those crevices!</p>



<p>PSA: As much as we love to have fun, please make sure to have a safe ride home as there will be no adult sleepovers at this hash. Thanks in advance!&nbsp;</p>
