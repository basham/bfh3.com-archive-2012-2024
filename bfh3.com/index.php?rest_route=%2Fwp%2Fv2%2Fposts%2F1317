It will turn into Kinser Pike somewhere past 17th Street. After 45\/46, continue one mile north. Cascades municipal Golf Course will be on the right. At around one mile, turn left on Winding Way. Go one and a half residential blocks and look for a white house on the left, corner of Stoneycrest and Winding Way. It is a two-story with red shutters and is dwarfed by a two-story treehouse in the big red maple tree. Park in the driveway or there is plenty of on-street parking.<\/p>\n<p>Everyone has a toga, right?
