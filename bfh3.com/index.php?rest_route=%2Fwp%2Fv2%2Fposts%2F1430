People will come, Ray. They&#8217;ll come to Morgan Monroe for reasons they can&#8217;t even fathom. They&#8217;ll turn up Forest Road not knowing for sure why they&#8217;re doing it. They&#8217;ll arrive at the start as innocent as children, longing for shiggy. Of course, we won&#8217;t mind if you join us, you&#8217;ll say. It&#8217;s only $6 per person, and<span class=\"text_exposed_show\"> free for virgins. They&#8217;ll pass over the money without even thinking about it: for it is money they have and peace they lack. And they&#8217;ll walk out to the trail; hashing in shirtsleeves on a perfect afternoon. They&#8217;ll find they have YBFs somewhere along one of the bad trails, where they checked like they were children and believed they were on trail. And they&#8217;ll watch the circle and it&#8217;ll be as if they dipped themselves in magic waters. The memories will be so thick they&#8217;ll have to brush them away from their faces. People will come, Ray. The one constant through all the years, Ray, has been hashing. America has rolled by like an army of steamrollers. It has been erased like a blackboard, rebuilt and erased again. But hashing has marked the time. This trail, this game: it&#8217;s a part of our past, Ray. It reminds of us of all that once was good and it could be again. Oh&#8230; people will come Ray. People will most definitely come.\u201d<\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fsl\"><span class=\"text_exposed_show\"><br \/>\nStart: Forest Headquarters (don\u2019t say it) at <\/span><\/span><span class=\"fsl\"><span class=\"text_exposed_show\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/turtle-again.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1431\" alt=\"turtle again\" src=\"http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/turtle-again-300x174.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"174\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/turtle-again-300x174.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.bfh3.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/turtle-again-1024x597.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"fsl\"><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">Morgan-Monroe State Forest<br \/>\nWhen: 4pm, Saturday, June 7<br \/>\nHow Much: $6 for veteran hashers, free for rookies<br \/>\nWhat: Beer, snacks, beer, and shiggy.

Take that about 8 miles north to the entrance of Morgan-Monroe State Forest. Turn right into the forest, and go a long way until you see the forest headquarters (no) on the left.
