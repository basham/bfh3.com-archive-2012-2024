We\u2019ve rented a shelter at Moore\u2019s Creek on Lake Monroe. It\u2019s a good spot for swimming. But bring sandals; the shore is a little rocky. We\u2019ll be serving spicy Italian sausage, \u00a0with a vegetarian option, beer, pasta salad, beer, tomato cucumber salad, and beer. The price for the hash is the usual $6 for wankers, free for virgins. The on after will be $7.<\/p>\n<p>Your hare will be Weird Al Spankabitch and the meal will be catered by Mothershucker and Bibliosex.<\/p>\n<p>Now Pay Attention Wanks! For some reason, Google Maps doesn\u2019t seem to have Moore\u2019s Creek SRA listed, so you can\u2019t just enter it into your phone and get there. Here\u2019s how you get there: Head (WSH?) south on Walnut and take a Left on Fairfax Rd. In about a mile turn left on Moffett Ln. This will eventually turn into Stipp Rd. Take a right on Handy Rd. and stay on it for 2 miles. Turn left on S. Shields Rd. When you get to the area, you\u2019ll see a big parking lot. Drive through it, past the bathrooms, and the shelter will be just a few feet away.\u00a0 BTW, this is where we started Gender, Upright, and Tite\u2019s Fool Moon in November.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Let\u2019s do the 4th of July Blooming Fools style with good food and lots of beer!
