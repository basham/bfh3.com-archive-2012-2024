The hares may be Mothershucker and White Lightning, and it may cost you $6, unless it\u2019s your first time, in which case it\u2019s definitely free. (Or if you\u2019re a veteran hasher and you don\u2019t bring a vessel of your own to drink from, in which case it\u2019ll cost you an extra buck for cup rental. Heck, if the world&#8217;s going to hang around, we might as well do our tiny part to keep it well.)<\/p>\n<p>When? Saturday, December 22, at 3 pm.<br \/>\nWhere? The Park and Ride lot across from Bryan Park pool on Woodlawn Avenue in Bloomington. Map is <a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/maps\/OVGfw\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<br \/>\nHow much? $6 for regulars with vessels, $7 for regulars without vessels, free for first-timers.<\/p>\n<p>* According to the Mayan calendar, or some random <a href=\"http:\/\/www.timeanddate.com\/countdown\/maya\" target=\"_blank\">website<\/a> claiming to represent the Mayan calendar, the world will end this Friday at 6:11 in the morning. We won&#8217;t even get to hash practice.
