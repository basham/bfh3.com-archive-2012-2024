Who knows. There aren&#8217;t any bears in southern Indiana anymore. But there are beery wanks aplenty. Is a beer drunk in the woods? Do we even need to answer that question? No. No, we do not. We need to demonstrate it with abandon. And what better time and place than prime leaf season at Brown County State Park. So bring your cameras, your appreciation for natural beauty, and your appetite for beer as we traipse through hill and dale, whetting our whistles (and checking them, too).<\/p>\n<p>Gear up to beer up! In addition to whistles, shiggy socks are recommended.<\/p>\n<p>And because it&#8217;s getting dark at ever earlier hours in them thar woods, the hash will start at 3pm. Let me repeat that: THE HASH WILL START AT 3PM!!! Be there or be sober!<\/p>\n<p>N.B. \u2013 Because it&#8217;s prime leaf season, everywank and her sister, brother, uncle, and 3rd nephew twice removed wants to see them at Brown County State Park. So plan accordingly. Assume that it will take ***at least ten minutes*** to get from the park gate to the BCSP Nature Center, whence we&#8217;ll set forth on our Colorful Beery Adventure\u00ae.<\/p>\n<p>N.B.B. \u2013 Expect the usual stupid Indiana State Park entry fee ($7 per vehicle\u2014$9 for out-of-state tags).
