No! Dammit, we&#8217;re out there, and we want beer. And at the 6\/9 Hash, we\u2019re going to stand up and do something about it.<\/p>\n<p>    Starting from the Beanblossom Shelter in Morgan-Monroe State Forest this Saturday at 4:00 pm, we\u2019re going to take the 69 percent to the shiggy. We\u2019re gonna march, hop, skip, skitter, lurch, crawl, stagger and otherwise ambulate across America (well, an infinitesimal part of it) for beer. Good beer. In our own vessels, in amounts that will satisfy a working-class thirst. And it\u2019ll only cost you $6. Cheep! (Unless you\u2019re a virgin, in which case you\u2019re free! Because deep down we\u2019re commie socialists at heart.)<\/p>\n<p>    The leaders of the 69 percent this weekend will be Goesintite (allegedly born in nineteen SIXTY-NINE) and White Lightning (born two years premature), who will be standing up for you by the beer keg as long as The Man lets us, or until the beer runs out, or we fall over, whichever comes first. Join the 69 percent! Because, \u201cwhatever doesn\u2019t go in you, goes on you\u201d isn\u2019t just for hashing anymore.<\/p>\n<p>    Directions to the start: Take Walnut north outta town. At the first light after the bypass, at the bottom of the big hill, take a right onto Old State Road 37. Go five miles to Anderson Road, and turn right onto Anderson Road. Go 4.4 miles, and turn left onto Beanblossom Road. Go approximately one mile, and look for the road to the left leading to the Beanblossom Shelter. Turn left, go down the road and park at the shelter. Look for the wankers occupying the beer keg.
