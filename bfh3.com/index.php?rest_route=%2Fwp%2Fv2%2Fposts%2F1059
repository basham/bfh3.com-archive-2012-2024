Here\u2019s your chance to recover your bum in the magical healing waters of the Lick\u2019er family private pond* Don\u2019t worry, for those who didn\u2019t get the full Anal experience last weekend, we found some painfully pleasurable shiggy for the rest of us to recover from. This hash event will include on-after food, swimming, and camping fun for those who choose to stay overnight. To accommodate all this romping and recovery (and to allow extra time to soak your poke-holes), we\u2019re starting the hash early at 2pm.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget your shiggy socks, bug repellent, lube, swim wear, chairs and camping gear. Restrooms (porta-jon\/outhouse) but no showers open for use \u2026 we know you like it dirty!!!<\/p>\n<p>Shiggy scale (1-5): 4 in some parts<br \/>\nDistance: 3\u20135 miles<\/p>\n<p>Shiggy includes thick brush, hills, ticks and chiggers<\/p>\n<p>On-After food will include fresh pesto pasta and sides from the Lick\u2019er farm. And because we know you enjoy sloppy seconds, leftover pulled pork from Analversary.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to bring something to share and\/or your own meat to slap on the grill, feel free to do so. BYO cooler for this purpose.<\/p>\n<p>The farm is located west of town in Green County, and was the site of last year\u2019s St. Patty\u2019s day hash. We encourage carpooling and suggest the Big Lot\u2019s parking lot. Drive takes aprox. 30 minutes.<br \/>\nCum to the farm\u2026your asses will thank you!<br \/>\nYour anal rehab specialists are hares Rocky Mount Her High, Lick\u2019er in the Hole, and Gibbon it Up Daily.<\/p>\n<p>Map:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/maps\/NfLkW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow\">http:\/\/goo.gl\/maps\/NfLkW<\/a><br \/>\nGPS:\u00a039.16479, -86.7319<br \/>\nTime: Sat, Aug 17, 2013 at 2pm<\/p>\n<p>Cost for hashing and anal therapy sessions is free for virgins and $6 for experienced degenerates.
