A mini-event hosted by BFH3 MisManagement. Where will it be? What will it be like? Well, you&#8217;ll just have to cum and find out.<\/p>\n<p>Esteemed BFH3 JM Kinsey and veteran hare Titwad are laying us a trail most mysterious&#8230; all we know is that we need to arrive on time, because the start location is so awesome we can&#8217;t even park there. Meet up in the parking lot behind Oolitic Town Hall at 109 Main Street in Oolitic IN, promptly at 3:00 PM, and wankers will be bussed from there to the start location until 3:15 PM. Why all the mystery? Well, even PH doesn&#8217;t know that, but knowing these hares there is a dang good reason to keep you in suspense! Just make sure you get yourself there by 3:00, <span class=\"text_exposed_show\">and since Oolitic is a 25 minute drive from the south side of Bloomington, any wankers who want to carpool are encouraged to meet up at Lucky&#8217;s on South Walnut by 2:15, and on-out by 2:30.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>If that isn&#8217;t enough to entice you, we&#8217;re also having our sorta-annual BFH3 Easter Kegg Hunt! This year your JM PH is feeling nostalgic for BFH3 traditions of yore, so this year we&#8217;re reviving the classic easter kegg hunt tradition of NOT hunting for eggs with candy and other such innocent nonsense. That&#8217;s right wankers, bring your easter baskets because we&#8217;re HUNTING FOR BEERS! After the hash is over we&#8217;ll turn you wanks loose on a space in which we&#8217;ve cleverly and not-so-cleverly hidden a whole bunch of BEERS!<\/p>\n<p>Any beers you find, you can take home or swap with other wankers, and there will be one extra-special beer that will earn you bragging rights AND a free fridge-sized keg for your guzzling pleasure! AND&#8230; it won&#8217;t cost you one dime extra! Cum one cum all for one of the funnest old-school mini-events of the year!<\/p>\n<p>NOTE: Last bus to start location leaves at 3:15 pm &#8211; WE MEAN IT! If you miss the bus you will not be able to find the start point and you will miss the hash and the Kegg Hunt.<\/p>\n<p>$7 Experienced Hashers, free for first-timers.<\/p>\n<p>When: Saturday, March 26 at 3 PM<br \/>\nWhere: Parking lot behind Oolitic Town Hall,109 Main St, Oolitic, IN 47451<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s time for EASTER KEGG!
